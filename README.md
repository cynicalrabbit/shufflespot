# shufflespot
There's a lot of controversy over shuffle, how it works, whether it is really random. This is a simple autohotkey script that can be used to test shuffle results yourself and should work on any system which allows AHK to be installed. Make sure you are not clicked into the playlist view (no songs highlighted) to use it or the starting track will be the same.
